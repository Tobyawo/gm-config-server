Explanation of the Deployment Configuration
Containers:

gm-access: Your application container, writing logs to /var/log/gm-access.
fluentd: The Fluentd sidecar container configured to read logs from /var/log/gm-access.
Volumes:

log-volume: An emptyDir volume that both containers share for logging.
fluentd-config: A ConfigMap-mounted volume containing fluent.conf, Fluentdâ€™s configuration file.
Fluentd ConfigMap:

Configures Fluentd to tail log files in /var/log/gm-access and output them.
The @type stdout directive outputs logs to stdout for testing. Replace with the appropriate plugin to
send logs to your preferred backend (e.g., Elasticsearch, a central Fluentd aggregator, or other services).
